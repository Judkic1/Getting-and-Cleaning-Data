# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Modifications to Original Data

 #### 1.) Both testing and training data sets were merged to create one all-emcompassing data set.
 #### 2.) Only measurements pertaining to the mean and standard deviations were extracted from the merged data set.
 #### 3.) Activity names ranged from 1-5; renaming was conducted to ensure accurate descriptions were provided.
 #### 4.) Variable names were subsequently cleaned up to avoid confusion.

## Description of Data

  ### 1.) Data Identifiers
  #####  Subject: the ID of the subject.
  #####  Activity: the name of the activity performed while measurements were obtained.
